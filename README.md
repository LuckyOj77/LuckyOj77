# 👋 Hello, I'm Lucky — Data Scientist & Analytics Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

## 💼 About Me

I specialize in:
- 🔍 **Data Analysis & Visualization** using R, Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), and SQL
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** – from regression models to ensemble techniques, and deep learning explorations
- 🗃️ **Database Management** – querying, optimizing, and structuring data with SQL
- 📊 **Storytelling with Data** – creating visual narratives that support smart decision-making

I thrive at the intersection of data and strategy, combining technical expertise with business understanding.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Programming: `Python`, `R`, `SQL`
- ML Frameworks: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `TensorFlow` *(learning in progress!)*
- Visualization: `ggplot2`, `matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Power BI`
- Data: `Pandas`, `dplyr`, `Tidyverse`, and cloud databases

## 🌱 Current Goals

- Sharpening my skills in **MLOps** and **Cloud Data Engineering**
- Collaborating on open-source data science projects
- Publishing thoughtful insights on machine learning and analytics trends
